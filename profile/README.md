That's right! We are **Comfora,** a open-source community organization that develops projects _(which are somewhat useless projects)_ with transparency in mind and a possible creative chaos leader?
Our professional way of saying this are, *"We are an open-source community organization committed to developing and building projects that are collaborative, impactful, and accessible to everyone."*

Bingo. ðŸ’¯
